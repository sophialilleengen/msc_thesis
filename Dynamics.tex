\section{Adaptive dynamics: Can actions of accreted globular clusters constrain the gravitational potential?}\label{sec:Dynamics}

\subsection{Integrals of motion}
This Section is based on \S3.1, \S3.2 and \S3.5 of \citet{Binney...Tremaine...2008}. Objects (e.g., stars and \acp{GC}) move on orbits which are described by their positions and velocities in 6 dimensional phase space, (\textbf{x}, \textbf{v}). Functions $I$, which are constant along an orbit, are called integrals of motion \citep{Binney...Tremaine...2008}:
\begin{equation}
    I[\mathbf{x}(t_1), \mathbf{v}(t_1)] = I[\mathbf{x}(t_2), \mathbf{v}(t_2)]
\end{equation}
for any $t_1$ and $t_2$. This means, that the derivative of these integrals is 0:
\begin{equation}
    0 = \dot{I}
\end{equation}
In an axisymmetric potential as we assumed and fitted in Section \ref{sec:Auriga} there are three independent coordinates so we have a six dimensional phase space which can be described by three integrals of motion. 
\subsubsection{Energy and angular momentum}
Energy E and some components of the angular momentum \textbf{L}, depending on the symmetry of the potential, are regarded as classical integrals of motion. In a spherical potential, all three components of $\textbf{L} = \textbf{x} \times \textbf{v}$ are integrals of motion while in the axisymmetric potential $\Phi$ only the axis about the potential is symmetric is the component of the angular momentum which is the integral of motion (usually $L_z$). The energy is given by the Hamiltonian H,
\begin{equation}
    H(\mathbf{x, v}) = \frac{1}{2}v^2 + \Phi = E
\end{equation}
with the total velocity $v$. In this axisymmetric potential the integrals of motion are supplemented by a third integral of motion, $I =$ constant, which, in general, does not have an analytic expression and therefore is a non-classical integral. 
\subsubsection{Actions}
\textbf{General introduction to actions} A particular set of integrals of motion are actions which, together with angles, create a canonical coordinate system. These actions are three momenta, $\mathbf{J} = (J_1, J_2, J_3)$, which describe the whole orbit while the angles, $\bm{\theta} = (\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3) $ define the position of the object on the orbit. Orbits for which actions can be calculated are called regular orbits. The three actions are given by the integral
\begin{equation}
    J_i = \frac{1}{2\pi}\oint_{\gamma_i}\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathrm{d}\mathbf{q} \qquad i = 1,2,3
\end{equation}
over the path $\gamma_i$ with vector $\mathbf{q}(t)$ and corresponding momentum $\mathbf{p}(t)$ given a Hamiltonian system which satisfies 
\begin{equation}
    \dot{\mathbf{q}} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{p}} \quad;\quad \dot{\mathbf{p}} = - \frac{\partial H}{\partial \mathbf{q}}. 
\end{equation}
The range of the angles is by construction $\theta_i = [0,2\pi]$ so that it moves periodically around the center of the galaxy. Since $0 = \dot{J} = -\partial H / \partial\theta_i$, the Hamiltonian is independent of $\bm{\theta}$. Its function of time t is therefore 
\begin{equation}
    \dot{\theta}_i = \frac{\partial H}{\partial J_i} \equiv \Omega_i(\mathbf{J}), \quad \mathrm{a\ constant} \quad \Rightarrow\quad \theta_i(t) = \theta_i(0) +  \Omega_i t
\end{equation}
with the circular frequency $\Omega = v_{circ}/r$. The components of $\bm{\theta}$ evolve linearly in time. 
\\\\\textbf{Definition in cylindrical coordinates} In the axisymmetric potential we have the spatial coordinates $(R, \phi, z)$ which we can use for the axes along we examine the actions $\mathbf{J} = (J_R, J_\phi = L_z, J_z)$. The actions quantify the oscillation of the orbit along a given axis. $J_R$ described how the objects moves towards and away from the galactic center, the radial oscillation, and $J_z$ the oscillation above and below the equatorial plane while $J_\phi = L_z$ is the angular momentum along the symmetry axis. 

\textbf{Numerical calculation of actions} Only in a simple spherical symmetric potential, the Isochrone potential $\Phi(r) = -GM/b + \sqrt{b^2+r^2}$ with scale length $b$, actions can be calculated analytically. To numerically calculate the actions of objects in our axisymmetric potential from Section \ref{sec:Auriga}, we need to use approximations.

\subsection{Globular cluster sample selection}\label{subsec:GC_selection}
Due to the resolution of the simulation, $\mathrm{M} = 5 \cdot 10 ^ 4\ M_{\odot}$, we set one stellar particle as one \ac{GC}. All stellar particles which were accreted by the main halo are followed through the evolution and kept as accreted \acp{GC} as long as they do not cross the disk in a sense that they either are directly in the disk - defined per snapshot as within the radius $\mathrm{R}_d = 0.1  \mathrm{R}_{200}$ and the height $\mathrm{z}_d = 0.03\ R_d$ to match the \ac{MW} disk's height in the $z = 0$ snapshot - or changed signs between successive snapshots while being inside the disk radius since we assume that in these cases the \ac{GC} would be disrupted.

These remnants will be considered the \ac{GC} populations of each merger event.}\label{fig:progenitors_distribution}
\end{figure}
The positions of the remnants of these three merger events are shown in Figure \ref{fig:progenitors_distribution}. Progenitor 3 and 4 are totally dispersed in the galaxy while progenitor 2 still shows some merging features such as broad streams, especially visible face-on. Progenitor 2 has nearly a factor of 100 more remaining \acp{GC} than the other two progenitors. This is due to the short time it is in the main galaxy and therefore could these \acp{GC} are neither as much dissolved as the others nor as much disrupted by the disk. Since these three mergers are so different at redshift 0, it is interesting to test their behaviour in action space, where dynamical features are expected to be visible longer. 

\subsection{Globular clusters in action space}\label{subsec:GCs_action_space}
Now, we look at the \ac{GC} distribution in action space. Our assumption is that in the "true" potential, \acp{GC} are very clumped since they should retain dynamical memory from their former \ac{DG} and therefore their \ac{DF} should be a delta function. In section \ref{subsubsec:GCs_actions_right_pot}, we will look at the distribution in the fitted potential at redshift 0. In section \ref{subsubsec:GCs_actions_varying_pot}, we evaluate actions in varying potentials to test our assumption of \acp{GC} being most clumped in action space in the "true" potential. 

\subsubsection{Best fit potential}\label{subsubsec:GCs_actions_right_pot}

    \caption{Selected \acp{GC} from three different \acp{DG} in action space. The diagonal elements show histograms of each action and the other panels show 2d histograms of each action pair. In pink/blue/yellow, we see the action distribution of the remnants of prog2/prog3/prog4. Since we have many more particles from prog2, the histograms in the diagonal elements are dominated by their distribution. In the correlation panels, we can clearly distinguish prog 2 and prog 4 while prog 3 is very dispersed and does not have an identifiable center in any action. Even though the merger of prog4 happened the longest ago, it is still very clumped in all combinations, with the most clumpiness in J$_\mathrm{R}$-L$_\mathrm{Z}$. The distribution of prog2 is narrow in L$_\mathrm{Z}$ but very broad in J$_\mathrm{R}$-J$_\mathrm{Z}$. prog2 is corotating with the disk but with a higher angular momentum than the disk has (\(\bar{\mathrm{L_z}} = -2235\) kpc km s$^{-1}$). prog4 is clearly counter rotating.}
    \label{fig:act_all_merg_best_pot}
\end{figure}
We calculate the actions of the remnants of each progenitor in the best fit potential and plot them in Figure \ref{fig:act_all_merg_best_pot}. The remnants of the different merger events are best distinguishable in L$_\mathrm{Z}$. Prog2 is corotating with the disk but with higher angular momentum. Prog4 is counter rotating. Prog3 is more dispersed in L$_\mathrm{Z}$ but its mean is corotating with the disk as well. In the vertical action, the three remnant groups are not distinguishable and have means at \SI{1000-2000}{kpc.km.s^{-1}}. In J$_\mathrm{R}$, the groups are again distinguishable. 
\\The idea of this method is that in the right potential, these groups minimize their spread in action space. Prog4 is the most compact group, while especially prog3 is very dispersed. To quantify the compactness, we measure the standard deviation of each action. In the next Section, we compare the standard deviations of the radial and vertical actions of each group in different potentials to see, if we minimize them in the 'true' potential.

\subsubsection{Varying potentials}\label{subsubsec:GCs_actions_varying_pot}
To vary the potential in way it should affect the groups the most, we vary the \ac{DM} halo. We do this by keeping all best fit potential parameters constant and only vary the scale length a$_\mathrm{NFW}$. For the three groups in these potentials, we calculate the actions in the $z=0$ snapshot.

We would expect the standard deviation to be mimized at the best fit potential which is indicated with the vertical grey line. We see that the radial action would prefer a lower scale length (at \SI{17}{kpc}) while two of the three vertical actions would prefer higher scale lengths. The differences in $\sigma_\mathrm{J_z}$ are much smaller than the one in $\sigma_\mathrm{J_R}$.}\vfill\label{fig:a_NFW_diagnostic_plots}}}
\end{figure}
In Figure \ref{fig:a_NFW_diagnostic_plots}, we see how the standard deviations evolve in the different potentials. 

\subsection{Time evolution of actions}\label{subsec:time_evo_actions}
We evaluate the time evolution of the orbits of the accreted \acp{GC} to how the actions evolved and to see if there was a point - probably shortly after their mergers - where the \acp{GC} were more clumped in action space. We calculate the actions of the selected particles in the best fit potential in each snapshot.
